# Description

The correct pin is hardcoded in Keypad.js


# To do

1. Add settings and pass it down with props/Redux/Context or useContext + useReducer
2. Add a 'settings' icon and add the possibility to change the correct pin, block & timeout time
3. Improve the design. Possibly add popups with errors, block, etc.
